# R Subsetting Error: Using = instead of ==

This repository demonstrates a common error in R programming related to subsetting data frames. The error occurs when the assignment operator `=` is mistakenly used instead of the equality operator `==` within a logical subsetting condition.  This leads to unexpected behavior, often resulting in assigning a value rather than performing a comparison, and can be hard to debug.

The `bug.r` file contains the code illustrating the incorrect usage, while `bugSolution.r` provides the corrected code.

This is a frequent mistake for programmers transitioning from other languages.
